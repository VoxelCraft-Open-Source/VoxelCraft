• Security Policy
=

We only support the latest stable version for security issues. See the releases page.

• Reporting Errors
=

We ask that you report major vulnerabilities privately, by contacting a developer.

Depending on severity, we will either create a private issue for the vulnerability and release a patched version of VoxelCraft, or give you permission to file the issue publicly.
