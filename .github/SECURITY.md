Security Policy
=

We only support the latest stable version for security issues. See theÂ releases page.

Reporting a Vulnerability
=

We ask that you report vulnerabilities privately, by contacting a developer, to give us time to fix them.

Depending on severity, we will either create a private issue for the vulnerability and release a patch version of VoxelCraft, or give you permission to file the issue publicly.
